        "Machine learning involves predicting and classifying data and to do so you employ various machine learning models according to the dataset. Machine learning models are parameterized so that their behavior can be tuned for a given problem. These models can have many parameters and finding the best combination of parameters can be treated as a search problem. But this very term called parameter may appear unfamiliar to you if you are new to applied machine learning. But don’t worry! You will get to know about it in the very first place of this blog and you will also discover what is the difference between a parameter and a hyperparameter of a machine learning model. This blog consists of following sections:<br>\n",

        "Think of the function parameters that you use while programming in general. You may pass a parameter to a function. In this case, a parameter is a function argument that could have one of a range of values. In machine learning, the specific model you are using is the function and requires parameters in order to make a prediction on new data.\n",

        "The best way to think about hyperparameters is like the settings of an algorithm that can be adjusted to optimize performance, just as you might turn the knobs of an AM radio to get a clear signal. When creating a machine learning model, you'll be presented with design choices as to how to define your model architecture. Often times, you don't immediately know what the optimal model architecture should be for a given model, and thus you'd like to be able to explore a range of possibilities. In a true machine learning fashion, you’ll ideally ask the machine to perform this exploration and select the optimal model architecture automatically. \n",
        "\n",
        "You will see in the case study section how the right choice of hyperparameter values affect the performance of a machine learning model. In this context, choosing the right set of values is typically known as “<i>Hyperparameter optimization</i>” or “<i>Hyperparameter tuning</i>”.\n",

        "<h3>Grid searching of hyperparameters:</h3>\n",
        "Grid search is an approach to hyperparameter tuning that will methodically build and evaluate a model for each combination of algorithm parameters specified in a grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s consider the following example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose, a machine learning model X takes hyperparameters a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub> and a<sub>3</sub>. In <i>grid searching</i>, you first define the range of values for each of the hyperparameters a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub> and a<sub>3</sub>. You can think of this as an array of values for each of the hyperparameters. Now the <i>grid search</i> technique will construct many versions of X with all the possible combinations of hyperparameter (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub> and a<sub>3</sub>) values that you defined in the first place. This range of hyperparameter values is referred to as <b><i>grid</i></b>.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "Suppose, you defined the grid as:<br>\n",
        "a<sub>1</sub> = [0,1,2,3,4,5]<br>\n",
        "a<sub>2</sub> = [10,20,30,40,5,60]<br>\n",

        "\n",
        "<br><br>Now, <i>grid search</i> will begin its process of constructing several versions of X with the grid that you just defined. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>It will start with the combination of [0,10,105] and it will end with [5,60,125]. It will go through all the intermediate combinations between these two which makes <i>grid search computationally very expensive</i>. \n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3>Random searching of hyperparameters:</h3>\n",
        "The idea of random searching of hyperparameters was proposed by James Bergstra & Yoshua Bengio. You can check the original paper [here](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf). \n",
        " \n",
        "<br><br>Random search differs from grid search. In that you longer provide a discrete set of values to explore for each hyperparameter; rather, you provide a statistical distribution for each hyperparameter from which values may be randomly sampled.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>Before going any further, let’s understand what distribution and sampling mean:\n",
        " \n",
        "<br><br>In Statistics, by distribution, it is essentially meant an arrangement of values of a variable showing their observed or theoretical frequency of occurrence.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>On the other hand, Sampling is a term used in statistics. It is the process of choosing a representative sample from a target population and collecting data from that sample in order to understand something about the population as a whole. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>Now let's again get back to the concept of random <i>search</i>.\n",
        " \n",
        "<br><br>You’ll define a sampling distribution for each hyperparameter. You can also define how many iterations you’d like to build when searching for the optimal model. For each iteration, the hyperparameter values of the model will be set by sampling the defined distributions. \n",
        "One of the main theoretical backings to motivate the use of random search in place of grid search is the fact that for most cases, hyperparameters are not equally important. According to the original paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>“<i>….for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new datasets</i>.”\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>In the following figure, we're searching over a hyperparameter space where the one hyperparameter has significantly more influence on optimizing the model score - the distributions shown on each axis represent the model's score. In each case, we're evaluating nine different models. The grid search strategy blatantly misses the optimal model and spends redundant time exploring the unimportant parameter. During this grid search, we isolated each hyperparameter and searched for the best possible value while holding all other hyperparameters constant. For cases where the hyperparameter being studied has little effect on the resulting model score, this results in wasted effort. Conversely, the random search has much improved exploratory power and can focus on finding the optimal value for the important hyperparameter.\n",
