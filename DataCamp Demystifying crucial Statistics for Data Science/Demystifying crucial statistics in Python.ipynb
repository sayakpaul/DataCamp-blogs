    "It is very important to find out the degree of the correlation of the features in a dataset. This step essentially serve you as _feature selection_ which concerns selecting the most important features from a dataset. This step is one of the most vital steps in a standard machine learning pipeline as it can give you a tremendous accuracy boost that too within a lesser amount of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For better understanding and to keep it more practical let's understand why features can be related to each other: \n",
    "\n",
    "- One feature can be a determinant of another feature\n",
    "- One feature could be associated with another feature in some degree of composition\n",
    "- Multiple features can combine and give birth to another feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation between the features can be of three types: - **Positive correlation** where both the feature change in the same direction, **Neutral correlation** when there is no relationship of the change in the two features, **Negative correlation** where both the features change in opposite directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation measurements form the fundamental of filter-based feature selection techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can mathematically the relationship between samples of two variables using a statistical method called [Pearson’s correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient), named after the developer of the method, **Karl Pearson**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can calculate the Pearson's correlation score by using the `corr()` function of `pandas` with the `method` parameter as `pearson`. Let's study the correlation between the features of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset that you used earlier. You already have the data in a well shape. "

Statistical methods that expect data in a rank format are sometimes called _rank statistics_. Examples of rank statistics can be rank correlation and rank statistical hypothesis tests. Ranking data is exactly as its name suggests.\n",
