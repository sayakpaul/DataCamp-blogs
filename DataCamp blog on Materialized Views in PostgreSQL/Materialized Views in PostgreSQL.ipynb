      "source": "If you work in SQL (preferably a PostgreSQL user) extensively or on an average level to query databases, then you might have written a good number of complex queries to find answers to critical questions. Also, sometimes it so happens that you need to use the results of those queries quite frequently in your works. Running a complex query multiple times can be _expensive_. What if there was a way to cache the results of a complex query to aid the performance? Well, _materialized views_ are there for you. \n\nYou might be thinking there are simple _views_ also which can store the result of a query. But a simple view differs from a materialized view from multiple aspects. Here is what the [official documentation of PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/sql-createview.html) says about simple views - \n\n>  The view is not physically materialized. Instead, the query is run every time the view is referenced in a query.\n\nThe statement means that simple views are not physically stored in the database. Each time a view is used in a query, the query that created the view is executed. Now, this is what makes simple views a bit inefficient when it comes to access time. \n\nOn the other hand, materialized views come with a lot of flexibility by allowing you to persist a view in the database physically. And you can operate on the materialized views just like you do in case of simple views (but with a lower access time). For the rest of this tutorial, you will be studying about materialized views in PostgreSQL. In one of his [webinars](https://support.datacamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009513793-Sept-2018-Webinar-A-Day-in-the-Life-of-a-Data-Scientist), DataCamp's Chief Data Scientist David Robinson showed how he uses materialized views to effectively store the results of complex queries. \n\n**Note** that in order to follow along with this tutorial, you should be familiar with the contents covered in the [Joining Data in SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-postgresql) course.

This would help you in the latter sections of the tutorial as well. You can restore [this database backup](http://tinyurl.com/y29da6er) which contains the table which you are going to use in this tutorial. If you want to learn how to restore a database backup in PostgreSQL, you can follow the first section of [this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/intro-to-where-clause-sql). \n\nIf you were able to restore the backup, you should see a table named `international_debt` within the database (you will need to create a database first, if you don't have one). Let's quickly take a look at the first few rows of the table (a simple select query will help you do this) -  \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/0J2Y700/Capture-1.png)"

The debt column shows the amount of debt (in USD) a particular country has in a particular category. The data belongs to the domain of economics and is often used to analyze the economic conditions of different countries. The data was collected from the [World Bank ](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/debt/ids/)."

If you append the `WITH NO DATA` option, an empty materialized view gets created. You cannot query this materialized view.
