    "Being a professional programmer, you need to be excellent at the basic things like variables, condition statements, data-types, access specifiers, function calling, scopes etc. No matter what kind kind of program you are writing - be it a program for a Middleware, be it a program related to Web Development or Data Science, these are some of the most basic things you, as a programmer, need to know to a great extent. You are programmer first and then you are a Data Scientist or Web Developer or Machine Learning Engineer etc. \n",

    "One such very important concept is **Recursion** and it is extremely vital to know while you are writing functions of a particular type. You may already know that - \"It is called Recursion when a function calls itself.\" But what happens under the hood? How the physical memory gets affected by Recursion? Can you turn every other function into a recursive function? In this tutorial, you will be finding answers to these fundamental questions. Specifically, you will cover: \n",

    "You must be thinking now, why on earth someone would write a recursive function if there are better alternatives available? Yes, sometimes, it gets real hard to trace a recursion but once you get used to the practice you will find recursion to be absolutely beautiful in terms of program readability and variables. Recursion needs no extra variables in order to get executed but it needs a proper termination condition to stop. Often, it gets difficult to find the termination condition for a recursion. Then again, \"Practice makes you perfect\". Later in this tutorial, you will see how beautiful and small a program can be if it is implemented with recursion other than the conventional means. Now, you will proceed towards studying the memory representation of a recursive function. "
