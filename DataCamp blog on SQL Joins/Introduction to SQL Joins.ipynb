    "During your data analysis in SQL, you will often need to look at multiple tables and join them to get the desired results. Joining tables for analyzing data is a required skill for a data scientist as well. In this tutorial, you will learn about different types of joins that you can perform in PostgreSQL. You will first study the preliminary concepts of joins in SQL, you will then learn about different types of joins and what are their syntaxes in PostgreSQL. You will finish off this tutorial by executing different types of join queries using two tables. To be able to follow along, you should be familiar with the basics of SQL and how to write simple queries in PostgreSQL. If you are looking for resources learn these, the following ones can be useful - \n",

    "SQL Joins allow you to collate two or more (sometimes just one table) tables using common identifiers. Take the example of the above two tables that you created - both the tables have `id` column in common. You may question the need of joining in SQL. Let's discuss this in brief. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to [normalization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/database-normalization-normal-forms/) constraints, you may not have all the required information present in a single table. Normalization is not only desired but also is necessary in order to maintain consistency, to reduce redundancy and to prevent several insertion and update anomalies. Consider the above two table again. Suppose you wish to find out the streams in which `Sayak` has enrolled. To get the answer to this question, you will need to join the two tables (sub-queries can also be used, but let's not consider that now) and then proceed accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "For two tables to be joined there has to be something in common between the two. Does this mean both the tables have to have at least one column with the same name? Or what exactly is this condition? \n",
    "\n",
    "The tables you wish to join **may not have a column with the same name** but logically they should be the same i.e. their data-types should be the same. You cannot join two tables having a column with the same name but different data-types. Let's now study the different types of SQL joins. "
