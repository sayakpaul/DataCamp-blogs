    "Generalization refers to how well the concepts learned by a machine learning model apply to specific examples not seen by the model when it was learning (testing set in short).\n",

    "Overfitting happens when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on unseen data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.\n",
    "<br><br>Overfitting is more likely with nonparametric and nonlinear models that have more flexibility when learning a target function. As such, many nonparametric machine learning algorithms also include parameters or techniques to limit and constrain how much detail the model learns.\n",
    "<br><br>For example, decision trees are a nonparametric machine learning algorithm that is very flexible and is subject to overfitting training data. This problem can be addressed by pruning a tree after it has learned in order to remove some of the detail it has picked up.\n",

The problem is: what is exactly something. In terms of Machine Learning, you talk about learning algorithms or models, and what is actually inside the algorithms or models? That’s the set of parameters. In short, Regularization in machine learning is the process of regularizing the parameters that constrains / regularizes or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. In other words, this technique discourages learning a more complex or flexible model, so as to avoid the risk of Overfitting.\n",

As mentioned before, Overfitting can be interpreted that your model fits the dataset so well, which it seems to memorize the data we showed rather than actually learn from it. Intuitively, having large coefficients can be seen as an evidence of memorizing the data. For example, you got some noises in our training dataset, where the data’s magnitude is far different than the others, those noises will cause our model to put more weight into the coefficient of higher degree, and what you received is a model that overfits our training data!\n"
