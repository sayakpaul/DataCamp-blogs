To remove a file or a folder a from your current working directory, `rm` command is often used. Suppose, you have a text file named `demo.txt` and you ran `rm demo.txt` in order to remove the text file. In this case, `demo.txt` is the _argument_ which you spplied to the `rm` command. If you do not pass any _argument_ to the `rm` command, you will get an error like so - \n",
