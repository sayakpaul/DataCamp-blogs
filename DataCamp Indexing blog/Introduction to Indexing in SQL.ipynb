    "Before you start studying about anything on indexing, it is really important that you understand how data is organized physically inside files. Obviously, you are not going to go into all the details but having a good overview of the organization will help you in understanding _indexing_ very clearly. Let's get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "Organization of records/data in general deals with how the records are stored and broadly the organizations can be divided into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordered organization**: All the records in a file are ordered in some search key value. **[Binary search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/)** is generally incorporated to search for any value residing inside the ordered file. This makes the search very efficient as the search time complexity remains within _logarithmic time_. But insertion to the file becomes an expensive operation because you might have to reorganize the entire file to facilitate the new item. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unordered organization**: In this type, records are inserted in the file wherever place is available, usually to the very end of the file. As linear search is used for this type, the search is not as efficient as the previous variant but insertion is not that of an expensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you have an ordered organization of files what if the block sizes of the files and size of each record inside the files are very big? Let's explore this in the next section. "
