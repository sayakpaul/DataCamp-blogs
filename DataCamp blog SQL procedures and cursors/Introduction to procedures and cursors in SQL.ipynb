Be it a web application, be it an API or be it a n in-house application, RDBMS is there. And SQL is the language for querying an RDBMS. \n",

    "In this tutorial, you will learn to write procedures and cursors; another important aspects of SQL. Have you ever wanted your RDBMS to automatically perform a certain of actions when a particular action is taken?

Well, you are going to take just the right tutorial. "

    "**Implicit cursors** are automatically created by Oracle whenever an SQL statement is executed, when there is no explicit cursor defined for the statement. Programmers cannot control the implicit cursors and the information in it. Whenever a DML (Data Manipulation Language) statement (INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE) is issued, an implicit cursor is associated with that statement. For INSERT operations, the cursor holds the data that needs to be inserted. For UPDATE and DELETE operations, the cursor identifies the rows that would be affected. \n",

    "You can refer to the most recent implicit cursor as the SQL cursor, which always has the attributes like:\n",
