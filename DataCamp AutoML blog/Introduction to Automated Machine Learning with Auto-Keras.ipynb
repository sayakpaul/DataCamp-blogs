With the virtue of their platforms it is really easy nowadays to get started in this field with almost no prerequisites. However, the term **Automated Machine Learning** is making a lot of headlines these days on the popular Data Science education forums. Many organizations like **Google**, **H2O.ai** etc. are working commendably in this area. This is not a very common topic as compared to _Machine Learning_. Because machine learning deals with the _automation_ part itself; so naturally the question that hits the mind first - \"_Can machine learning be also automated?_\"\n",

    "## Understanding a standard Machine Learning pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are solving a problem as a Data Scientist, your standard workflow looks something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "3. Initialize a machine learning model that may be suitable for the problem\n",
    "4. Train the model\n",
    "5. Test the model\n",
    "6. Tweak the parameters of the model\n",
    "7. Again test the model\n",
    "8. Communicate the results\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step _Data Preprocessing_ is very broad in its context because it is essentially one of the most time consuming tasks in the above pipeline and it includes many sub tasks such as Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Feature Selection etc. The steps from 3 to  7 is just for one machine learning model. A good practitioner will certainly not stop after just one model, he will try his experiments on different models so as to compare their results and finally decide on the best model for the problem. So, here comes another very time-consuming set of tasks - **Deciding on which model to choose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following quote regarding the _debugging process_ in a machine learning task could not be more apt and it is really important to keep in mind: \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\"_Debugging for machine learning happens in two cases: 1) your algorithm doesn't work or 2) your algorithm doesn't work well enough.[...] Very rarely does an algorithm work the first time and so this ends up being where the majority of time is spent in building algorithms._\" - [S. Zayd Enam](https://twitter.com/zaydenam)</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, by now, you must have got a brief idea of a standard machine learning engineering task? Ultimately you will have to decide which model is the best for the problem at your hand and you also need to explain why it is the best. At times, you will be under situations where the number of possibilities to try is just too many but the deadline is not that far. - Getting the essence of the problem? Let's find out more. "

    "## How the Machine Learning pipeline can be automated?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will continue this section with the notion of deciding the best model for a problem and a situation where the number of possibilities and the deadline are inversely proportional to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the very beginning of this tutorial you encountered one question \"Can machine learning be also automated?\" This question is not at all silly. Even the great [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/) in one of his interviews described Automated Machine Learning as **\"the automation of automating automation\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Revisit the step number 5 from the standard workflow of a data science task you just studied - _Tweak the hyperparameters of the model_. Say, you have finished preparing data for the further steps and you have just initiated a classifier $X$. Now, say, $X$ takes 5 different hyperparameters. So, you will have to try the same classifier $X$ but with different sets of hyperparameter values which is definitely not an easy task to execute. Now comes the more troubling part. After trying out various combinations, you discovered that the results are not well enough. So, you decided to test four more classifiers (each with 6 different hyperparameters). Can you imagine how time-consuming can this be? Even after that, what if you do not get good results? Investigation of that will be nothing but another heavily time-consuming process. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the very idea of Automated Machine Learning comes from this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"_If numerous machine learning models must be built, using a variety of algorithms and a number of differing hyperparameter configurations, then this model building can be automated, as can the comparison of model performance and accuracy.\"_ - [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/current-state-automated-machine-learning.html)"
